# Documentation Updates Process - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Review All Memory Bank Files

1.  Access and review the contents of all core Memory Bank files:
    - `memory-bank/projectBrief.md`
    - `memory-bank/productContext.md`
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
    - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
    - `memory-bank/techContext.md`
    - `memory-bank/progress.md`
2.  Review any additional context files or folders within the `memory-bank/` directory.
3.  Identify sections that require updates based on recent changes, new discoveries, or user requests.

## 2. Document Current State

1.  Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` to reflect the current work focus, recent changes, and active decisions.
2.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to detail what currently works, what remains to be built, and any known issues.
3.  Ensure all relevant files accurately describe the project's current status.

## 3. Clarify Next Steps

1.  In `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, clearly outline the immediate next steps for the project or current task.
2.  Ensure these steps are actionable and align with the overall project goals.

## 4. Document Insights and Patterns

1.  Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with any new learnings, important patterns, or project insights gained during recent work.
2.  If significant architectural or technical patterns have emerged or changed, update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` and `memory-bank/techContext.md` accordingly.
3.  Ensure that documented insights are concise, actionable, and contribute to Cline's long-term knowledge.
