# Progress: Optimal Fund Allocation Minisite

## Current Status
The basic project scaffolding is complete. This includes:
- Creation of `src/` and `memory-bank/` directories.
- Initialization of core memory bank files (`projectBrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`).
- Migration of the prototype HTML content into `src/index.html`.
- Separation of CSS into `src/style.css` and JavaScript into `src/script.js`.
- Initialization of a Git repository and an initial commit.

## What Works
- The project directory structure is set up.
- The memory bank is populated with initial context.
- The `index.html` file is in place and correctly links to external CSS and JavaScript files.
- The core calculation logic and UI functionality are preserved.
- Git repository is initialized and the initial state is committed.

## What's Left to Build
- **Refinement of Prototype:** The existing code needs further review for production readiness, including:
    - Potential optimization of the optimal allocation algorithm.
    - Improved error handling and input validation.
    - Accessibility enhancements.
    - Responsive design improvements.
- **Testing:** Implement automated tests for the calculation logic.
- **Deployment:** Plan for deployment of the static minisite.

## Known Issues
- The current setup relies on CDN for Tailwind CSS, which is fine for a prototype but not ideal for production due to potential performance and reliability concerns.
- The optimal allocation algorithm might need further review for edge cases and absolute mathematical optimality.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial decision to keep the project as a single HTML file for rapid prototyping has been executed. The next phase involved modularizing the code by separating CSS and JavaScript.
- The memory bank has been established as the primary source of truth for project context and progress.
