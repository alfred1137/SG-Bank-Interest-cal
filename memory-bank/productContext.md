# Product Context: SG Fund Allocation Optimizer

## 1. Problem Statement

Maximizing interest earnings from savings accounts in Singapore is complex. High-yield savings accounts like UOB One, DBS Multiplier, and SC Bonus$aver offer attractive interest rates, but they are tied to specific conditions and tiered structures.

The key challenges for users are:
-   **Tiered Rates**: Each bank has multiple interest rate tiers based on the account balance. The highest rates are often capped at a certain amount (e.g., the first S$100,000).
-   **Conditional Bonuses**: To unlock the highest rates, customers must meet specific criteria, such as crediting their salary, spending a minimum amount on a credit card, investing, or insuring through the bank.
-   **Mental Overhead**: Calculating the optimal way to distribute funds across multiple accounts with different rules is a time-consuming and error-prone manual process. It's not immediately obvious how an extra dollar should be allocated to yield the maximum return.

## 2. Solution

The SG Fund Allocation Optimizer solves this problem by providing a simple, instant, and accurate calculation tool. It acts as a specialized calculator that takes the user's total funds and banking conditions as input and outputs a clear, actionable allocation plan.

By automating the complex decision-making process, the tool empowers users to:
-   Quickly see the most effective way to distribute their money.
-   Understand the potential interest they can earn.
-   Make informed decisions about their personal finances without needing to build complex spreadsheets.

## 3. User Experience (UX) Goals

The user experience should be:
-   **Simple and Intuitive**: The user interface must be clean and straightforward. Users should be able to input their data and get results with minimal effort.
-   **Transparent**: The tool should clearly display not just the final numbers but also a breakdown of how the interest is calculated for each bank and tier. This builds trust and helps users understand the "why" behind the allocation.
-   **Responsive and Fast**: All calculations happen client-side, ensuring instant feedback as the user adjusts inputs.
-   **Focused**: The tool does one thing and does it well. It avoids feature bloat and focuses entirely on the core task of optimizing fund allocation for maximum interest.
