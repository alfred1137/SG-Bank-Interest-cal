# Project Brief: Singapore Bank Interest Calculator Minisite

## Objective
To develop a web-based minisite that calculates the optimal fund allocation across multiple Singaporean banks to maximize monthly interest earnings, based on user-defined total funds and bank-specific conditions.

## Scope
The project involves refining an existing HTML prototype, structuring the project directory, setting up a memory bank for Cline, and initializing a GitHub repository. The core functionality is the interest calculation and optimal fund allocation logic.

## Key Features
- Input for total funds.
- Selectable conditions for different bank accounts affecting interest rates.
- Calculation of optimal fund allocation across the different bank.
- Display of estimated monthly interest and a detailed breakdown per bank and tier.
- Display of overall interest rate achieved.
