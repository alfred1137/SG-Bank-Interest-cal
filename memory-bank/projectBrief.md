# Project Brief: Singapore Bank Interest Calculator Minisite

## Objective
To develop a web-based minisite that calculates the optimal fund allocation across multiple Singaporean banks (UOB, SC, DBS, CIMB) to maximize monthly interest earnings, based on user-defined total funds and bank-specific conditions.

## Scope
The project involves refining an existing HTML prototype, structuring the project directory, setting up a memory bank for Cline, and initializing a GitHub repository. The core functionality is the interest calculation and optimal fund allocation logic.

## Key Features
- Input for total funds.
- Selectable conditions for UOB, SC, and DBS accounts affecting interest rates.
- Calculation of optimal fund allocation across UOB, SC, DBS, and CIMB.
- Display of estimated monthly interest and a detailed breakdown per bank and tier.

## Initial Prototype Analysis
The provided `Prototype.html` contains the core HTML structure, CSS (via Tailwind CSS CDN and inline styles), and JavaScript logic for calculations and UI updates. It serves as a good starting point, but needs further development for production readiness.

## Next Steps
1. Create remaining core memory bank files.
2. Move the `Prototype.html` content into `src/index.html`.
3. Initialize a Git repository and make an initial commit.
